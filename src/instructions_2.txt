Like all the layers, the payload is again encoded with
Adobe-flavoured ASCII85. After ASCII85 decoding the payload,
apply the following operations to each byte:

  1. Flip every second bit
  2. Rotate the bits one position to the right

For example:

                        |      Binary      Decimal  Hex
  ----------------------+-------------------------------
  Starting value        | 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0    180     B4
                        |   v   v   v   v
  Flip every second bit | 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1    225     E1
                        |  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
  Rotate to the right   | 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 )  240     F0
                        |  \_____________/

Here are some hints:

 - Bits can be flipped easily using XOR.

 - You can extract specific bits into a separate value using
   AND. This is called "masking".

 - You can use OR to combine some of the bits from one value
   with some of the bits from another value. Just make sure
   that the unimportant bits are masked (all set to zero).
   For example, if you want the first 4 bits of a byte
   combined with the last 4 bits of another byte:
   10100000 OR 00001010 = 10101010

 - Bit shift operations discard bits on one side, and add
   zeros to the other side. If you want to retain the bits
   that will be shifted off the end of a byte, you probably
   need to mask it into a separate variable before doing the
   shift.
